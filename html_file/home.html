        <p class="txt">The mission behind Clary is to aid students who want to be well
           informed about classes and teachers at SJSU. As the new school year starts
           students question if they will be able to succeed in classes without knowing
           the curriculum or the teacher. That transition between highschool and college is
           complicated for some students since in college you must pick your own classes which
           many seem overwhelming to some students who do not know any teachers or teacher styles
           on campus.  How could a student be able to know what they are choosing, if they don't
           now how the teacher is? That's where clary comes in. Clary is a website that allows
           students to compare the different lecture styles of different professors. Throughout
          the website the students find the overview of what the class appear to look like with certain
          professors.</p>

      <div class="section quote"><p class="txt"> *Some words from your Clary providers*
        As a student you are striving to achieve a higher education
        but you are also trying to grow as a person. When you enter
        classes you will struggle but thats life and can't do anything
        except run with it and be informed. Remember that success is not
        something guaranteed from academic work but also overcoming obstacles
        and  the understanding about life itselfâœŠ</p>
