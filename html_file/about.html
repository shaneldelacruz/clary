    <h1> About Us </h1>
    <div class="boxed">
      <p>  We are three students who met through a Google CSSI Program. Our task was to pick a problem that we've struggled with in the past and create a solution using the knowledege that we acquired during our 3 weeks session. We came up with an idea that would improve many student's courses selections. This way it would be easier for the students to be informed on the types of classes and professors that they will be signing up to. The process includes the comparison of the lecture styles of different professors who are teaching the same courses.    </p>
